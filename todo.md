# DDI Detection Tool MVP Development Plan

## Files to Create:
1. app.py - Main Streamlit application for DDI detection analysis
2. requirements.txt - Dependencies including streamlit, pandas, plotly, scikit-learn
3. sample_data.py - Sample drug interaction data and model performance metrics
4. components/ - Directory for modular components
   - data_loader.py - Data loading and preprocessing
   - visualization.py - Charts and graphs for model comparison
   - model_comparison.py - Model performance analysis

## Core Features:
1. Interactive model performance comparison dashboard
2. AUC-ROC, F1-Score, Precision, Recall metrics visualization
3. Sample drug interaction data display
4. Comparative analysis of GNNs, Transformers, and traditional ML models
5. Cold-start scenario simulation for novel drugs

## Implementation Approach:
- Use Streamlit for interactive web app
- Plotly for interactive visualizations
- Pandas for data handling
- Mock data based on research document predictions
